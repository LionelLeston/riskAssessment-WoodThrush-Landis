# riskAssessment-WoodThrush-Landis
This R project is for generating species distribution models of Wood Thrush and predicting current and future distribution of this species under different Landis scenarios in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Different BRT models are evaluated and validated and then a final model was selected for predicting Wood Thrush abundance and distribution from Landis-II scenarios within the Wood Thrush range in Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. This R project also stores outputs from the Landis-II scenarios generated from the final BRT model outside of this R project by Yan Boulanger. The outputs (predicted Wood Thrush abundance and distribution in 2100 A.D. from different scenarios with 5 simulation runs each) are then processed to create ZONATION conservation planning exercises for the spatial implementation of options to designate critical habitat for Wood Thrush. While the ZONATION exercises were run outside of this R project, there are self-contained ZONATION folders for each exercise stored within “CHID-Regionalmodel” and further processing of the ZONATION outputs takes place within the R project.
